# Codegasm: A Programmer's Bliss

*Codegasm (noun): the physical and emotional sensation experienced at the peak of coding excitement, often triggered by a code epiphany and usually accompanied by a successful code compilation.*

Imagine this: you're deep into a late-night coding session. The code flows like lava, but something's off—compilation fails, and you're stuck! You meticulously scan through each file, line by line, searching for that elusive error.

It's a challenging hunt, like finding a needle in a haystack. Just when frustration peaks, you spot it—a tiny mistake! And that's when the Codegasm hits! It's not just relief; it's an exhilarating rush of achievement! Embrace the highs and lows of coding with this visual reminder of those electrifying moments!
